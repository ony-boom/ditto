by using a simple declarative config file.

You define the packages you want, and Ditto installs them â€” optionally removing everything else
if you enable strict mode. It also supports dry runs, so you can preview changes safely.`,

By default, it will only install missing packages.

You can enable strict mode to remove all packages not listed in your config (excluding ignored ones).`,
